## What it does

Tutorial haven makes it easy for knowledgeable people seeking to make content from their knowledge to share their content while monetizing it and ensuring it still belongs strictly to them. It enables tips, payement and more on content uploaded to the platform.
People seeking tutorials on any topic whatsoever are able to find what they are looking for and if unbelievably they don't they can request for tutorials on very specific subjects for an amount thats put together by all other people who are interested in such a tutorial.

## Inspiration

I check youtube and other platforms evey other day for a tutorial on a certian topic and i'm sure most other people do to. Presently tutorials on all sorts of topics can be found online, some of them good and some bad. Tutorial haven aims to be the gathering point for all these tutorials and those who seek them.

## How I built it

- I used the powerful features of Next.js and the xdc apothem network.
- I built the Frontend using Next.js. For smart contract integration I used ethers and wagmi.
- I used firebase for the database and web3.storage for storing data and generating a URL for uploaded files to save with their NFT.

## Challenges I ran into

At the beginning I found it very hard to get started due to a lack of a design to follow and working on this myself.
One major challenge i faced on the way was connecting to the apothem network with ethers, i solved this after checking their documentaion and seeing that they had made major changes since V5 which i needed to reflect in my code.

## What I learned

This was a solo project and I had to work on everything myself, I learnt so much about design, the right places to get inspiration from and even a thing or two about the basics of UI design with Figma.
I greatly improved my understanding of firebase and ethers.js.
Working with the apothem network was fun, its transaction costs are low and integrating with it is very similar to most other networks on the ethereum network which makes it easy to work with.
Using Next.js on this project was an eye opener, I used great features I had not taken the time to learn like Next auth while getting to understand a bit more about how helpful Moralis can be.

## What's next for Prime Books

There are major updates coming up for Tutorial Haven, I will be finding ways to reduce how many transactions a user has to go through while maximizing the profits of our content creators.
There will be some UI upgrades, I'll be bringing in a UI designer to help with touching up the app.
one major feature that will be added is a bounty system for Tutorials, poeple can put together money and host a bounty for a great tutorial on a topic of their choice.
